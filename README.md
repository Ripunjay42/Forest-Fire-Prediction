# Forest-Fire-Prediction

1. Forest-Fire-Prediction is a web app which has a Machine Learning model running at the back.
   The forest fire is predicted based on the Temperature and Humidity. The dataset is prepared using the previously occured forest fires in the world.
   Using Data Science and Machine learning, we can build a model that takes in the detected fires dataset learns and detects future fires based on certain Weather report.
   the machine learning model has been trained using Logistic Regression Classifier with 91% accuracy.
3. Tools/ Technologies used : HTML, CSS, Python, SQLite3, Flask, etc.
